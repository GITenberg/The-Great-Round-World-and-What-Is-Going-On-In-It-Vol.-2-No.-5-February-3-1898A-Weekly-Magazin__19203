<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<div class='unindent'><big><b>R</b></big>APIDITY in learning to read depends upon the quickness with which the child's
attention shall be drawn to the substance by which the process is made more or
less an unconscious one. The method of this book's production has been as
follows: The story was first related to pupils from seven to nine years of age, in the
best form possible. Some days later, reproductions, both oral and written, were called
for. These reproductions (many hundred in number) formed the material for most
careful study as to essential elements of plot, salient points of interest, and <b>especially
the words and forms of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'epressions'">expressions</ins> used by children</b>. By this means the story
has been reconstructed. <b>Portions over which the children love to linger are
brought out to the fullest extent.</b> Their words and forms of language, within the limits
of grammatical usage, <b>are followed scrupulously</b>. <b>Less than seven hundred and
fifty words</b>, all of the commonest use among children, are used in the entire series.</div>

<p>Without attempting to formulate any principles or a philosophy of children's interests,
the author has simply sought <b>to draw the material from the child itself</b>.</p>

<p>These stories, in typewritten and mimeograph form, were used in the schools of Santa
Rosa, Cal., for many months, and in their present form are the product of much revision.</p>

<p>"<i>It may be safely said that in these stories there is a drawing power for the child that is assurance
that a resonant chord in the child nature has been struck.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frederick Burk</span>, Clark Univ.</p>

<p>As we go to press there is an uncertain
feeling resulting from the departure of our
cruiser for Cuban waters. It may provoke
a crisis, or it may lead to a better knowledge
of the true attitude of the administration
toward Spain.</p>

<p>Cuba continues to furnish us with its share of current
history; the news is no more encouraging than
that of previous weeks, however.</p>

<p>In the East the situation has not materially
changed. It continues interesting&mdash;so interesting that
this subject is uppermost in the minds of the civilized
world. While any day may witness the peaceful
settlement of the whole trouble, it is by no means
certain but that selfish motives of one of the Great
Powers may, at any minute, cause a general European
war.</p>

<p>England's attention is divided between China and
Egypt. The Indian and Chinese questions bid fair
to be merged, as there are indications that England's
attitude toward China is not an unselfish one.</p>

<p>In France the Dreyfus clamor has grown to a disturbance,
the disturbance to riot;&mdash;what next?</p>

<p>The short sketch of the life of Gladstone which will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
be published in next week's number should interest
all of our readers. The "Grand Old Man" is undoubtedly
the grandest figure in the history of the
century now closing, and his admirers are to be found
in every part of the world&mdash;many in our own country,
where self-achieved greatness is by no means uncommon.
His has been a life of constant, unremitted
labor in the advancement of the interests of his fellow-men.
No minute in his long life seems to have
been wasted, and to-day, when nearly ninety years of
age, he continues to labor to the utmost of his remaining
strength.</p>

<p>Our Naturalist has already received enough suggestions
for his projected book to enable him to
write a library, we think, but he says that he is quite
in earnest in wanting to hear from many thousand
boys and girls on this subject. His purpose is apparently
to make a book which shall be found just
right by all.</p>

<p>A batch of letters comes in from Baltimore, and the
subjects are so varied and interesting that we give
them in outline.</p>

<p>Jane H. wants to know about the mongoose: what
kind of snakes it kills; about sun-spots and their influence
on the seasons.</p>

<p>C. F. N. about the sky, sun, moon, and stars.</p>

<p>Philip H. H. about bees and crabs.</p>

<p>Edwin St. J. G. about horses, especially those with
long manes and tails.</p>

<p>Sidney G. about wild animals, lions; also snakes
and unfamiliar plants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Claude E. H. about Mother Carey's chickens. He
writes that his uncle shot one while crossing the
ocean.</p>

<p>Murray W. T. about birds and plants, "with pictures."</p>

<p>Howell G. about the quail, woodpecker, and other
birds. (We wonder if he has seen Grant's book on
birds, or "Bird Neighbors"?)</p>

<p>James M. about sea-lions and wild animals; also
about cats and domestic animals.</p>

<p>Denison F. about ant-eaters, lions, and whales.</p>

<p>Tom T. about the horse, dog, and python.</p>

<p>You can see by the above letters&mdash;and this was but
part of one mail&mdash;how many things our young people
want to know about, and what a task "Naturalist"
has taken upon himself.</p>

<p>From Sterling, Ill., comes a request from a number
of boys and girls for a book about wild animals and
how they live. (Ingersoll's "Wild Neighbors" is just
such a book.)</p>

<p>E. C., of Brookline, writes a very suggestive letter.
A few of his wants are as follows: chapters on garden-grubs,
and insects injurious to vegetation; caterpillars,
together with pictures of the butterflies that come
from them; birds' nests; colored pictures of beetles,
fossils, shells, etc. He says in conclusion: "Even
with things to see, you often need to be shown how
to look."</p>

<p>In this he is right, for we miss many beautiful
things in this world because we do not know "how
to look."</p>

<p>We wish to acknowledge with pleasure the well-written
letters from Point Grammar School, Glou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>cester,
Mass., from "Brenda P. S.," "Alberta S. M.,"
"Mary S. E.," and "Susan M."</p>

<p>The proposed annexation of the Hawaiian islands
is still being actively discussed in the Senate.</p>

<p>The friends of the bill are doing their best to present
every argument for it in the most convincing way.</p>

<p>Senator Morgan, however, went a little too far the
other day in his zeal in its behalf. He declared that
ex-President Cleveland wanted the islands to be annexed
to the United States, but that he thought the
ex-Queen ought first to be restored to the throne and
given an opportunity to let the islands be acquired
by purchase.</p>

<p>Mr. Cleveland promptly denied this statement. "I
can hardly believe Mr. Morgan made the assertions
imputed to him," he said in an interview. "He knew
perfectly well that I have been utterly and constantly
opposed to Hawaiian annexation. The first thing I
did after my inauguration, in March, 1893, was to
recall from the Senate an annexation treaty then
pending before that body. I regard the annexation
of these islands as a complete departure from our
national mission. I did not suppose that there was
any person in public life that had any doubt as to my
position in this matter.</p>

<p>"Aside from any question of annexation, and with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>out
harboring any design of restoring the Hawaiian
monarchy, I investigated the relation of our representatives
to its overthrow. This investigation satisfied
me that our interference in the matter was disgraceful
and wrong, and I would gladly, for the sake of our
national honor and fair fame, have repaired that
wrong; only this, and nothing more."</p>

<p>These remarks are important, as they refer back to
the very beginning of the troubles in Hawaii which
led to the present plan of making the islands a part
of the United States.</p>

<p>In saying that the annexation of the islands would
be a "complete departure from our national mission,"
Mr. Cleveland meant that it was the policy of our
Government not to go outside of America to acquire
territory, but to let other nations alone just as we
ourselves wish to be let alone.</p>

<p>This policy is very different from that of England,
for example, who has for many years been reaching
out to add to her already vast possessions. In other
words, our plan is opposed to what is known as the
"policy of grab."</p>

<p>By speaking of "our interference" in the Hawaiian
revolution as "disgraceful," Mr. Cleveland means that
the revolution was not only largely planned by
American residents on the islands, but that American
marines were called from the harbor of Honolulu to
the government building to assist the revolutionists,
or, as the revolutionists themselves declare, to protect
American interests on the islands.</p>

<p>Now that the question of annexation is before the
country, a prominent advocate for each side has appeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>We referred last week to the visit here of the President
of the Hawaiian republic, Mr. Sanford B. Dole.
He has recently stated his side of the matter, in an
interview.</p>

<p>And the deposed Hawaiian Queen Liliuokalani, or
"ex-Queen," as she is called, has presented her views
in the form of a book, giving an account of her whole
life.</p>

<p>Let us first see what Liliuokalani has to say.</p>

<p>In the first part of the book she tells us how she
was brought up. It is astonishing to read that,
though she was the daughter of one of the chiefs of
the island, she was sent, very shortly after birth,
to the house of another chief, named Paki, where
there was only one daughter, Bernice, and made a
member of his family.</p>

<p>This chief was married to a granddaughter of one
of the Hawaiian kings, Kamehameha I., so the
adopted girl was considered a member of the royal
family.</p>

<p>Here is the account Liliuokalani herself gives of her
adoption:</p>

<p>"I knew no other father or mother than my foster-parents,
no other sister than Bernice. I used to
climb up on the knees of Paki, put my arms around
his neck, kiss him, and he caressed me as a father
would his child; while, on the contrary, when I met
my own parents, it was with perhaps more of interest,
yet always with the demeanor I would have
shown to any strangers who noticed me.</p>

<p>"My own father and mother had other children,
ten in all, the most of them being adopted into other
chiefs' families; and although I knew that these were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
my own brothers and sisters, yet we met throughout
my younger life as though we had not known our common
parentage.</p>

<p>"This was, and indeed is, in accordance with
Hawaiian customs. It is not easy to explain its
origin to those alien to our national life, but it seems
perfectly natural to us.</p>

<p>"As intelligible a reason as can be given is that
this alliance by adoption cemented the ties of friendship
between the chiefs. It spread to the common
people, and it has doubtless fostered a community of
interest and harmony."</p>

<p>It is odd to think of a princess, even of an Hawaiian
princess, as being educated, like other girls, in a
school. But the school she attended was for those
pupils only who had some claim on the succession to
the throne.</p>

<p>Near-by, however, there was another school, where
some of the children of American residents were educated.
Among these was John O. Dominis, the son
of a sea-captain of Italian descent, and whose mother
was a Boston woman.</p>

<p>Young Dominis made the acquaintance of the
future Queen by climbing over the wall and talking to
the pupils of the Royal School, as it was called.</p>

<p>A number of years later, in 1862, Liliuokalani became
his wife.</p>

<p>This long name, by the way, was not given her
until 1877, when the heir to the throne died, and
she became the next in succession to the reigning
King Kalakaua.</p>

<p>This King may be said to have helped to cause the
revolution that made Hawaii a republic. In 1887 he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
was persuaded by the white residents, largely Americans
or the sons of Americans, to give the country a
new constitution that took away a great deal of his
power.</p>

<p>"It may be asked," the Queen writes, "Why did
the King give them his signature? I answer without
hesitation, because he had discovered traitors
among his most trusted friends, and knew not in
whom he could trust; and because he had every assurance,
short of actual demonstration, that the conspirators
were ripe for revolution, and had taken
measures to have him assassinated if he refused.</p>

<p>"His movements of late had been watched, and his
steps dogged, as though he had been a fugitive from
justice. Whenever he attempted to go out in the
evening, either to call at the hotel or visit any one
of his friends' houses, he was conscious of the presence
of enemies who were following stealthily on his
track.</p>

<p>"But, happily, Providence watched over him, and
thus he was guarded from personal harm.</p>

<p>"He signed that constitution under absolute compulsion.
Details of the conspiracy have come to me
since from sources upon which I can rely, which lead
to the conviction that but for the repugnance or
timidity of one of the executive committee, since
risen very high in the counsels of the so-called republic,
he would have been assassinated.</p>

<p>"Then they had planned for the immediate abrogation
of the monarchy, the declaration of a republic,
and a proposal for annexation to be made to the
United States.</p>

<p>"The constitution of the republic was actually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
framed and agreed upon, but the plot was not fully
carried out&mdash;more moderate counsels prevailed.</p>

<p>"They therefore took the very constitution of
which I have spoken, the one which had been drafted
for a republic, hastily rewrote it so as to answer their
ends, and forced Kalakaua to affix thereto his official
signature."</p>

<p>In 1891 Kalakaua died and Liliuokalani succeeded
him. Not long afterward she determined to try to
get back the power for the monarchy that had been
taken away.</p>

<p>This soon caused the revolution. Her enemies
brought a number of charges against her, and to the
chief of these she replies in her book.</p>

<p>Though comparatively few in number, her enemies
had so much power that they were able to overturn
the Government with little difficulty.</p>

<p>Then they appealed to President Cleveland, asking
that the islands be annexed.</p>

<p>As the President gave them no encouragement, they
continued to govern Hawaii as a republic.</p>

<p>In 1895 an effort was made to place Liliuokalani
again on the throne. It failed, and for a time the
ex-Queen was held as a prisoner.</p>

<p>After her release she came to this country to try to
secure the aid of our Government.</p>

<p>The Government, however, did not interfere.</p>

<p>Among our legislators and in our newspapers a
great deal of sympathy was expressed for the revolutionists
and a great deal said in favor of annexation.</p>

<p>At last the republic of Hawaii formally requested
that it be made a part of the United States. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
brought the matter before Congress, where, as we
have said, it is now being carefully considered.</p>

<p>In her book, Liliuokalani makes this strong appeal
to the people of the United States not to take sides
with those who have driven her from her throne:</p>

<p>"O honest Americans, as Christians, hear me for
my downtrodden people! Their form of government
is as dear to them as yours is precious to you. Quite
as warmly as you love your country, do they love
theirs. With all your goodly possessions, covering
a territory so immense that there yet remain parts
unexplored, possessing islands that, although near at
hand, had to be neutral ground in time of war, do
not covet the little vineyard of Naboth's, so far from
your shores, lest the punishment of Ahab fall upon
you, if not in your day, in that of your children, for
'be not deceived, God is not mocked.' The people to
whom your fathers told of the living God, and taught
to call 'Father,' and whom the sons now seek to despoil
and destroy, are crying aloud to Him in their
time of trouble, and He will keep His promise, and
will listen to the voices of His Hawaiian children
lamenting for their homes."</p>

<p>In view of all that Liliuokalani has to say, the
recent interview with President Dole is particularly
interesting.</p>

<p>After explaining that no special powers had been
granted him on his present mission by the Hawaiian
Senate, the President declared it was the belief of the
friends of annexation that if the recent amendment of
Senator Bacon, to let the question be decided by a
vote of the Hawaiian citizens, had been accepted, the
vote would be in favor of the treaty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>President Dole said that, in case of annexation,
Hawaii had in view no radical changes in legislation.</p>

<p>"The treaty provides," he said, "for the appointment
by the President of the United States of a commission
authorized to formulate and recommend to
Congress the legislation and forms of government for
Hawaii.</p>

<p>"The matter of franchise is now specifically provided
for by our laws. For those who elect Senators
there is a property and educational qualification; for
those who elect Representatives an educational qualification.
All electors must take an oath of allegiance
to the present Government and renounce allegiance to
monarchy.</p>

<p>"There is a strong sentiment on the island against
allowing Chinese and Japanese to become citizens.
There are cases where these races have acquired the
ballot, but they are very few, and the sentiment is
adverse to their becoming citizens.</p>

<p>"The natives are all citizens, and would have the
right of franchise. Under the regulations now governing
the franchise, about 4,000 votes were cast in
the election of 1894, and about 3,000 at the more recent
election."</p>

<p>President Dole made a glowing picture of the benefits
that this country would receive from annexation.
It would greatly encourage commerce between the
United States and Hawaii by making the trade absolutely
free, and it would open up to Americans a
great many industries, the chief among them being
coffee-growing.</p>

<p>It would also vastly improve the condition of the
islands themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>In case annexation is rejected by our Government,
President Dole says the Hawaiian Government will
continue much as it is at present.</p>

<p>Whatever happens, there is slight prospect that
Liliuokalani will be restored to her throne.</p>

<p>At last accounts, Havana was in a state of peace.
But it was feared that this peace would not
last, and an outbreak against the Americans was expected.</p>

<p>Only the other day Representative Amos Cummings,
of New York, made a fierce speech attacking
the Spanish authorities and urging our Government
to go to war with Spain and help to free Cuba. He
compared the condition of Cuba to-day with the condition
of the American colonies at the time of the
Revolution.</p>

<p>Then, too, a great meeting was recently held in
Boston to uphold Cuba's cause, and the feeling in
favor of the Cubans has been strongly shown throughout
the United States.</p>

<p>But the Cuban insurgents are suspicious of Americans,
because our Government has done nothing to
help them.</p>

<p>If the Government did do anything to assist the
Cuban cause, we should probably have a war on our
hands in a very short time.</p>

<p>In preparation for further trouble in Havana,
General Blanco is said to have gathered a large body
of troops in order to crush it at once.</p>

<p>General Blanco, however, decided not to remain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
in Havana, but to go east and take charge of the
campaign against the insurgents.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is reported that many of the
troops left Havana a few days after the riots, and
that the only signs of the disturbance were the
squads of soldiers left to guard two of the newspaper
offices that had been attacked.</p>

<p>Some of these troops, it is reported, have been sent
to Santiago de Cuba, where the insurgents have been
very active of late.</p>

<p>It was rumored recently that the seat of the Cuban
Government, near Cubitas, had fallen into the hands
of the Spanish.</p>

<p>This rumor, however, is believed to be false. Still,
the Spaniards have probably been doing some good
fighting in this neighborhood.</p>

<p>The Cuban President and his Cabinet are not likely
to be molested, as they are concealed in remote and
inaccessible mountain-passes.</p>

<p>A good deal of newspaper talk has been created by
the acceptance of General Blanco's Government by
Gen. Juan Mass&oacute;, cousin of President Bartolom&eacute;
Mass&oacute;, and his brigade, and by the surrender of
five private soldiers belonging to the command of
Gen. Maximo Gomez, the insurgent commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>These soldiers declare that General Gomez ordered
Captain Nestor Alvarez to be shot for attempting to
persuade insurgent soldiers to accept autonomy.
They have asked permission to form a guerilla force
to avenge the captain's death.</p>

<p>In various parts of the island the Cubans have been
doing a great deal of damage to property, but it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
impossible to know accurately just what they are
gaining by their devastations. The news sent from
the Cuban and the Spanish camps does not agree by
any means.</p>

<p>Both sides declare that they are making progress.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, however, that though the
Cubans had lost hope of receiving help from the
United States this winter, they have not lost courage.</p>

<p>At present they are busily engaged in transporting
supplies into the centre of the island, and they
propose to continue the campaign through the wet
season.</p>

<p>The Spaniards maintain that the insurgents are at
the end of their resources, that very misleading reports
of the war are sent to this country, and that
the Cuban Junta in New York gives information that
cannot be relied upon to the papers.</p>

<p>The Spanish minister has gone so far as to defy
Tomas Estrada Palma, who is at the head of the
Junta, to mention five Cuban generals who are now
in good standing.</p>

<p>He evidently hopes in this way to discredit the information
sent out by the Junta.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Junta discredits the reports
sent out by the Spaniards. In the case of Gen.
Juan Mass&oacute;, for example, it says that several months
before his surrender Mass&oacute; had been degraded from
the command, and that his so-called "brigade" consisted
only of a few personal followers; so his acceptance
of autonomy did not by any means indicate that
the insurgents were giving up the cause of Free Cuba.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>The excitement in France over the case of Captain
Dreyfus, instead of subsiding, has grown
even more serious.</p>

<p>For several days the students have paraded the
streets in small groups, uttering cries against Zola and
the Jews, and have been dispersed by the police.</p>

<p>It is said also that cries of "Long live the Emperor"
have been heard.</p>

<p>This suggests that the excitement may affect the
Government, after all, in spite of its apparent security
in recent years.</p>

<p>In Paris this seems to be a very easy thing to do.
More than once the Government has been overturned
by the mob.</p>

<p>In spite of their bitter experiences, the French
people of to-day are very like the French people of a
little more than a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>But the French people of a hundred years ago were
very badly governed and had terrible grievances.</p>

<p>At present, the French are well governed by rulers
of their own choosing.</p>

<p>It is very likely that those who cried out for the
Emperor were either jokers, or people eager to add to
the excitement, or else paid agents of the Imperial
party, which still hopes to restore the descendants of
the first Napoleon to the throne of France.</p>

<p>So far, the mob has accomplished nothing, and the
Government has stood firm.</p>

<p>In the Chamber of Deputies, however, the discussion
of the Dreyfus case has led to very serious complications.</p>

<p>One of the members, ex-Minister Cavaignac, de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>clared
that a report existed, written by Captain
Lebrun-Renaud, of the French army, which gave an
account of a confession of guilt made by Captain
Dreyfus. Monsieur Cavaignac blamed the Government
for keeping silent about this confession, on the
ground that by its silence it had practically led to a
reopening of the case. If the Government would declare,
he said, that the publication of the confession
would involve some foreign Power, this would end
further discussion of the matter. Otherwise, the
whole case ought to be made public.</p>

<p>Premier Meline replied that such a confession existed,
but the Government had decided not to publish
it, as it would change the character of a case that had
already been settled by competent judges. There
was, besides, he acknowledged, another cause for
keeping silence, the very cause that had made the
trial secret. This was not "excessively great," but it
was customary to conduct all such trials in secrecy, and
the custom was not to be violated in this instance.</p>

<p>The Premier then criticised the newspapers that
had taken sides with Dreyfus, and added that the Government
had done right in calling Zola to account for
insulting the army.</p>

<p>The President of the Chamber, Monsieur Brisson,
then leaped to his feet and implored the legislators
not to make a sensation while the streets outside were
in a turmoil.</p>

<p>Premier Meline replied that the Government would
quell the turmoil in the streets, and that those men
should be blamed for the scandal who had started it.
Then he condemned the socialistic newspapers for
their attacks on the Government.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>The socialistic newspapers are those papers that
advocate the doctrine of Socialism, which may be said
to have grown out of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Socialism is founded on the theory that all rights
and privileges and benefits should be shared equally
by all the members of the community, and that the
wealth of the world should be in the hands of the
Government, which should have the power of distributing
it. The citizens, instead of competing with
one another, as they do now, should work together
for the general good and be paid alike.</p>

<p>Many people believe that though this doctrine
sounds very Christian-like, it would not work. The
industrious would get no more for their labor than
the idle. So the idle would become more idle, and
the industrious would lose all incentive to do their
best.</p>

<p>At any rate, Socialism has made great progress
in France, and it is greatly feared there by its enemies.
Its friends, on the contrary, think that it is going to
make the world very much better than it is at present.</p>

<p>The friends of Socialism in the Chamber of Deputies
became greatly excited by Premier Meline's censure
of their papers. The excitement reached a climax
when one member accused another of being a scoundrel
and a coward, and several fights took place.
Even the people in the galleries fought among themselves,
and hurled abuse down at the members.</p>

<p>The scene was not unlike one of those disgraceful
scenes that took place in the Reichsrath of Austria a
few weeks ago.</p>

<p>The reporters were then asked to leave, and the rest
of the session was conducted in secret. On entering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the corridors the reporters found them crowded with
soldiers who had been called out at the beginning of
the trouble in case they should be needed.</p>

<p>Fortunately, their interference was not required.</p>

<p>Think of what the excitement is likely to be when
Zola is brought to trial!</p>

<p>There has been so much secrecy about the
Egyptian troubles that it is not easy to explain
England's present activity on the Nile.</p>

<p>The last report
says that Colonel
Parsons, on his way
to take Kassaba from
the Italians, met
King Menelik. The
King was very angry
because the town had
been surrendered to
the Egyptians. He
claimed that Kassaba
belonged to his
territory, and he was
then engaged in organizing an army to fight for what
he considered his right.</p>

<p>The situation in Egypt is further complicated by
the report that General Kitchener's Soudanese troops,
in whose fighting qualities he has had great confidence,
have shown signs of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>If they were to rebel against England's authority
at this time, the consequence might be very serious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Just now England is under such terrible expense
that it is thought that her present exchequer is in
danger of exhaustion.</p>

<p>She is sending forces to the Nile to settle the Egyptian
troubles there, and she has the uprisings on the
Indian frontier, which are likely to cause her considerable
expense.</p>

<p>Then, too, there is that vast loan which she has
offered to China and which is creating a sensation
among the European Powers.</p>

<p>England has taken a firm position with regard
to the occupation of Kiao-Chou by Germany and
the seizure of Port Arthur by the Russians.</p>

<p>She has openly sent two war-ships to each of these
ports.</p>

<p>This does not mean that she wishes to provoke war.
It is intended probably as a hint to Germany and
Russia that if they go too far she is ready to fight.</p>

<p>Germany, however, has repeated that Kiao-Chou
is to be a free port, and this statement is being echoed
with satisfaction by the English press.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the English papers show an astonishingly
warlike spirit, and the English people are said
to be delighted by the pluck and force which Lord
Salisbury has shown in this crisis.</p>

<p>During the past few years Lord Salisbury has been
accused of a willingness to make almost any concession
to avoid dragging England into a war.</p>

<p>A writer in the New York <i>Sun</i> has lately published
a very able and interesting article on the
relation of the United States to the present crisis in
the East.</p>

<p>In this country we have been so absorbed in watching
the rivalry between the European Powers over
China that we have given very little thought to its
effect on ourselves.</p>

<p>The writer in <i>The Sun</i> shows that it may affect us
very seriously.</p>

<p>He does not believe that there is any immediate
danger of a war as a result of the seizure of Kiao-Chou,
and he adds that the present excitement may
be "for the purpose of finding out just what the pretensions
of the various Powers are with regard to
China."</p>

<p>"The attitude of Great Britain," he writes, "is one
requiring close examination, because of the magnitude
and far-reaching character of her demands on
China. Briefly stated, they are:</p>

<p>"First, that China shall accept a loan guaranteed
by Great Britain; secondly, that as security the customs
administration shall be placed under her agents,
with a contingent control of the <i>likin</i> or internal customs;
thirdly, the right to push the Burmese railways
at once into Yunnan and Sechuen; and, fourthly,
that no cessions of territory shall be made to any
other power south of the Yang-tse-kiang."</p>

<p>The immense importance of these demands the
writer very clearly explains.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">WESTERN GATE, PEKIN, CHINA.</span>
</div>

<p>If England were to grant China the enormous loan
that she needs to pay the war indemnity to Japan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
she would secure "a controlling voice in all future
financial transactions which the Chinese Government
might wish or be forced to undertake."</p>

<p>If China agreed to the second proposition, England
could manage the customs in such a way as to "attract
the vast bulk of the internal trade of China to herself."</p>

<p>He writes further:</p>

<p>"The third and fourth demands hang together, but
have to be treated separately. The concession to
Great Britain of the unrestricted right to construct
railways from Burmah into the southwestern provinces
of China would have the effect of turning them
into commercial tributaries of Great Britain.</p>

<p>"A railway connecting Rangoon in Burmah by way
of Bhamo with Ichang at the head of navigation on
the Yang-tse-kiang would act as a suction pipe to draw
away to the port of Rangoon the trade of the most
prosperous and flourishing parts of China, and give
products taking that route the advantage of many
days in point of time and of distance in the race for
the European markets. By just so much trade as
might take the British route through Burmah, would
the potential trade of other Powers, with no other but
all sea routes from the coast at their command, be
diminished.</p>

<p>"The advantage British manufactures would have
for entry and distribution into the vast and populous
regions which the British Government proposes to
penetrate by means of railways constructed by British
capital, and affording employment to British labor
and shipping, are too obvious to need enlarging upon.</p>

<p>"A glance at the map will show that the better half
of China proper, territorially and commercially,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
would, by the concession of the third and fourth of
England's demands, be placed under her practical
control."</p>

<p>The writer believes that the fourth demand is aimed
at stopping the advance of the French in China beyond
Tonquin.</p>

<p>Now comes the point of his article most interesting
to us as Americans.</p>

<p>How are our interests in China to be affected by
the European encroachments there?</p>

<p>They would be greatly injured, the writer points out,
if any European Power were to secure such control in
China that our Chinese trade would be restricted.</p>

<p>Consequently, our interests are on the side of China
and of Japan, for the Japanese must now be looking
with astonishment and alarm at the possible partition
by European Powers of the nation which she herself
conquered only a short time ago.</p>

<p>"It cannot possibly be for the advantage of this
country to aid in establishing the financial and commercial,
with the eventual political, predominance of
any one country in China."</p>

<p>And further:</p>

<p>"The protestations in the British press and by
prominent members of the British Government, that
England does not ask for herself any privileges that
she is not willing to see extended to all other nations,
is fine political rhetoric, but one has only to point to
India, and ask how much Great Britain's control and
administration of that country, with its vast population,
have contributed to the general commerce and
wealth of the world."</p>

<p>In the Reichstag the other day, Baron von Buelow
made an important announcement regarding the
killing of the German missionaries in China that led
to the German occupancy of Kiao-Chou.</p>

<p>The negotiations between Germany and China over
the affair, he said, were now practically concluded,
and with very satisfactory results.</p>

<p>The Governor of Shan-Tung had been removed and
would be forever barred from holding another public
office.</p>

<p>Six officials, accused by Germany of taking part
in the murders, had also been degraded and punished,
and the actual perpetrators of the crimes would be
treated as they deserved.</p>

<p>China had promised to pay heavy damages for the
injury done to the mission, and would, moreover, provide
for the erection of three churches, each marked
with a tablet to indicate that they were under the
protection of the Emperor.</p>

<p>China would also furnish the money necessary for
the erection of seven residences for the Catholic prefecture
of Tsao-Chou-Fu.</p>

<p>The Chinese Government finally agreed to issue a
special Imperial edict to insure the future protection
of the German missions.</p>

<p>Major Williams, who was sent to London by
the Treasury Department to inquire into the
means for enforcing the new sealskin exclusion act,
has acknowledged that his inquiries have discouraged
him. He believes it will be impossible for the Gov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>ernment
to enforce the law in its present form. Comparatively
few of the sealskins can be identified after
they have passed through the hands of the wholesale
and the retail dealers.</p>

<p>So it looks as if the Government would have to find
some other way to protect the seals from threatened
extinction.</p>

<p>The observations of the eclipse of the sun on the
22d of January, taken at Talni, India, are said
to have been completely successful.</p>

<p>The astronomers who had gone to Talni from
Great Britain to represent the British Astronomical
Association, and from the Lick Observatory at San
Francisco, succeeded in taking some excellent photographs.</p>

<p>While the eclipse was complete, the light is said to
have equalled that of the full moon.</p>

<p>Wherever observations were made, the results are
reported to have been satisfactory.</p>

<p>During the eclipse, Venus, Mars, and Mercury were
clearly seen.</p>

<p>The report that Mr. Gladstone is in very feeble
health has been confirmed.</p>

<p>It looks now as if one of the greatest careers in the
whole history of England would soon be ended.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, however, has always had such remarkable
vitality that his admirers all over the world
hope that he will be spared a few years longer.</p>

<p>Still, there can be no doubt that his work is over.
And what wonderful work it has been!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>As Mr. Gladstone was born in Liverpool on the
29th of December, 1809, he is now in his eighty-ninth
year.</p>

<p>Since 1894, when his failing eyesight forced him to
leave public life, he has lived very quietly at his
home in Hawarden.</p>

<p>But he has continued to take an active interest in
public affairs, and he has devoted himself to the
studies in which he has had a life-long interest. On
several occasions, too, he has spoken out on subjects
of grave importance, showing his old-time vigor and
courage.</p>

<p>His death would be a loss not only to England, but
to the world at large.</p>

<p>He has always taken a deep interest in the American
Government and in the American people.</p>

<p>In this country, "the Grand Old Man," as Mr.
Gladstone has long been called, is regarded with
great admiration and affection.</p>

<p>An account of Mr. Gladstone's career will be published
in a later number of <span class="smcap">The Great Round
World</span>.</p>

<p>It will show why he is so highly honored as a
statesman, a writer, and as a friend of his fellow-men.</p>

<p>Many readers of <span class="smcap">The Great Round World</span>
doubtless remarked the great strike that took
place in Chicago more than three years ago, and the
share in it of Debs, the political agitator, which led
to his imprisonment.</p>

<p>Within the past few months Debs has been busily
engaged in making plans to found a colony for unem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>ployed
men and women, where they will be given
opportunities of earning a living.</p>

<p>He has lately purchased 30,000 acres of land in
Tennessee for this purpose.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to watch the outcome of this
experiment.</p>

<p>As a rule, experiments of this kind are not successful.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that this new undertaking will
prove to be an exception.</p>

<p>Our workingmen certainly need help. All over the
world they are complaining, and many people believe
that, unless their condition is improved, they will resort
to violence against the rich.</p>

<p>So all efforts in their behalf are particularly interesting
at this time.</p>

<p>It is announced that the Emperor of Germany, who
is fond of roving about the world, will start on
his much-discussed trip to the Holy Land about the
middle of next April.</p>

<p>He is to start from Hamburg on his yacht with his
two eldest sons, and he will return in six weeks.</p>

<p>It is reported that he will then pay a visit to the
Sultan at Constantinople.</p>

<p>Europe watches every move of the Emperor's with
the greatest interest and with curiosity as to whether
it has a political significance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>A NEW SPRING-POST FOR BICYCLES.&mdash;This
post does not seem to have the objectionable
features that other spring-posts have. It is small,
neat, compact, and at the same time does its work admirably,
as we have reason to know, having had it
tested. The illustration shows quite clearly how it
is constructed. To the ordinary observer, when it is
attached to a bicycle it appears to be an common
seat-post; the spring, however, prevents the constant
vibration which is so trying to the rider and so hard
on the machine, especially in riding over cobblestones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus-035.png"><img src="images/illus-035-tb.png" alt="Spring-Post" title="Spring-Post" /></a></div>

<p>Riding a machine with this spring-post, as compared
with one without it, is very much like riding
in a spring carriage as compared with the ordinary
springless cart.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus-036a.png" alt="Buoy with light" title="Buoy with light" /></div>

<p>A clever invention, which originated in France,
is a life-saving buoy that has been used on the
River Seine in Paris. Persons falling into the water
at night often lose their
lives because it is impossible
to ascertain their
whereabouts; or, if a life-saving
apparatus of any
kind is thrown to them in
the darkness, they frequently
drown before they
can find it. This small apparatus
consists of a combination
of a buoy with an
electric light; when the buoy is thrown into the water
the light is lighted automatically. In connection with
this invention the life-savers in Paris use a grappling-hook
which we illustrate. This has an electric
light near the end in the oval space; this light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
makes it possible to grapple for persons who may
have gone down beneath the water.</p>

<p>We have also received from France the account
of an invention in the shape of a bicycle
lamp in which acetylene is burned. The great difficulty
with the use of acetylene has heretofore been
that the gas will not burn unless under high pressure,
and the receptacles in which the gas is generated
could not be so made as to insure them against ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>ploding.
Acetylene gas, as generally used, is generated
by bringing water in contact with the calcium
carbide. The gas forms so rapidly that it is extremely
difficult to control it, therefore the attention
of inventors has been directed to this question. This
lamp seems to be a very clever arrangement for producing
the gas in the right quantity without danger
of explosion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus-037.png"><img src="images/illus-037-tb.png" alt="Acetylene lamp" title="Acetylene lamp" /></a></div>

<p>It is described very clearly by the illustration herewith.
The upper part, "E," is a small reservoir in
which water is put; this water is released in small
quantities through the tube at the right, and, flowing
into the lower part of the lamp, comes in contact with
the calcium carbide, which is in the receptacle "P";
the gas thus generated is held in the reservoir "G,"
and when sufficient pressure has been created is forced
out through the burner "B."</p>

<p>The lamp is small and compact; it is but four
inches high, and yields a beautiful bright light which
will not blow out. When it is desired to put the light
out, the button "R" is pressed down, thus shutting
off the supply of water; this stops the generation of
the gas, and the lamp soon goes out.</p>

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
